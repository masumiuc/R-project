## Relationship Between Flipper Length and Body Mass of palmer penguins.

The below code chunk will generate a plot diagram which shows the relationship between flipper length and body mass of the three species of the penguins Adelie, Chinstarp, and Gentoo.

```{r Flipper Length vs Body Mass, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=flipper_length_mm, y=body_mass_g, color = species))+
  labs(title = "Palmer Penguins: Body Mass vs Flipper Length", 
       subtitle = "Sample of three palmer penguin species", 
       caption = "Data was collected by Dr.Kristen Gorman")
```
